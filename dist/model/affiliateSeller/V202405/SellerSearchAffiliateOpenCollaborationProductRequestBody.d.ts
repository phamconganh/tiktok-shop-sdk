    * A list of product keywords. Product titles, or names, are loosely matched. Keywords in the list form a query and the resulting set of matching product names is based on the conjunctive operator `AND` between each keyword. For example, the keyword list `[\"Men\", \"Fashion\"]` creates a query `\"Men\" AND \"Fashion\"` and the resulting set of matching product names contains the loosely matched conjuction of \"Men\" and \"Fashion\" such as \"Male Fashionable\". Maximum length of the list is 20 keywords. Maximum keyword string length is 255 characters.
